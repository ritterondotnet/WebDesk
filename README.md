# WebDesk
### The WebDesk Project
The WebDesk project could be called one of the most pointless projects ever. Its goals are to:
- Turn common web apps that are accessed in the browser into full-screen desktop apps through Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)
- Critics may say that this is utterly pointless, as end users may just as well open up a browser and point it to the URL of the web app.
- I disagree; I like having desktop apps with their very own full screen windows, etc.
- The best part is keyboard shortcuts; some are blocked by the browser. In WebDesk apps, all keyboard shortcuts except those bound to the host operating system will work.
